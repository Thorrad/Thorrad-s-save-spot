    "motivations": "I am a creative person who is interested in where the ideas of cryptographically secure systems can be applied to make the world a safer, more secure and seamlessly connected place. I was inspired by seeing how Cardano was rolling out various systems to make it fair and distributed in a way that was also transparent. I want to help usher in the new era and make the goals of Cardano come true.",
    "objectives": "I have been passionate about Cardano since 2018 when I first found out about it. It seems that Cardano was striving to solve many issues that I saw in Cryptocurrencies and related systems. It was attempting to be fast, robust, light, nimble and to include both an Identity component and self governance while also being built on peer reviewed code. I want to help Cardano enter its new era with my focus on Marketing and Branding so we are known for what Cardano has been built to do. \n",

    "qualifications": "I am a sole proprietor business owner working in the field of photography and video production. I have been in business for myself for over 35 years and bring along a keen focus on branding and story telling. I want to engage with the various committees to bring focus to the marketing and branding aspects of this new era of Cardano. I think that there are likely to be a bunch of great delegates involved in coding and operations, and I think I can bring a good deal of assistance to marketing. ",
